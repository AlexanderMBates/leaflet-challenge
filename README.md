# Leaflet Challenge

## Introduction

The Leaflet Challenge involves visualizing earthquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) using Leaflet, a JavaScript library for interactive maps. The challenge aims to create a meaningful visualization that allows the USGS to better educate the public and other government organizations about natural hazards.

## Getting Started

### Repository Setup

1. Create a new repository for this project called `leaflet-challenge`. Do not add this challenge to an existing repository.
2. Clone the new repository to your computer.
3. Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the Leaflet challenge with subdirectories `Leaflet-Part-1` and `Leaflet-Part-2`.

### File Structure

Download the necessary files from the [Module 15 Challenge files](#) to help you get started. The main files to run for analysis will be in the `Leaflet-Part-1` directory.

## Create the Earthquake Visualization

### Instructions

1. Obtain the earthquake dataset from the USGS GeoJSON Feed page.
2. Choose a dataset to visualize (e.g., "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days") and get the JSON representation of the data.
3. Use Leaflet to create a map that plots all earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude.
4. Size the data markers based on earthquake magnitude and color them based on depth.
5. Include popups that provide additional information about each earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
6. Create a legend to provide context for the map data.

### Code References

- [HTML Code](#) - Reference for the HTML structure.
- [JavaScript Code](#) - Reference for the JavaScript code to set up the map, add markers, and create a legend.

### Execution

- Open the HTML file in a web browser to visualize the earthquake data on the Leaflet map.
